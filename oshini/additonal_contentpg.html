    <p class="pa">Invented in the mid 16th century in Spain The guitar originally had four courses of strings, three double, the top course single, that ran from a violin-like pegbox to a tension bridge glued to the soundboard, or belly.</p>
    <h3 id="his" class="sub-head2">History</h3>
    <p class="pa">The violin-type pegbox was replaced about 1600 by a flat, slightly reflexed head with rear tuning pegs; in the 19th century, metal screws were substituted for the tuning pegs. The early tied-on gut frets were replaced by built-on
      ivory or
      metal
      frets in the 18th century. The fingerboard was originally flush with and ended at the belly, and several metal or ivory frets were placed directly on the belly. In the 19th century the fingerboard was raised slightly above the level of the
      belly
      and was extended across it to the edge of the sound hole.

      In the 19th century the guitar’s body also underwent changes that resulted in increased sonority. It became broader and shallower, with an extremely thin soundboard. Internally, the transverse bars reinforcing the soundboard were replaced by
      radial bars that fanned out below the sound hole. The neck, formerly set into a wood block, was formed into a brace, or shoe, that projected a short distance inside the body and was glued to the back; this gave extra stability against the pull
      of
      the strings.</p>
    <h3 id="fe" class="sub-head2">Features</h3>

    <p class="pa">The guitar consists of a hollow wooden body with six strings stretched over it and along a narrow neck. Guitars usually have a single, round sound hole in the body. The strings can be strummed with the fingers or plucked. Some
      guitarists use a
      plectrum (triangular piece of plastic) to sound the strings.</p>

    <h3 id="ty" class="sub-head2">Types Of Gutairs</h3>
    <h4 class="sub-head2">Electric</h4>
    <p class="pa">An electric guitar is a guitar that produces sound by vibrating strings over a pickup that converts the vibrations into electrical signals. Those signals are fed into an amplifier, which projects the musical performance at a wide
      range of volumes</p>
    <h4 class="sub-head2">Acoustic</h4>
    <p class="pa">An acoustic guitar is a fretted musical instrument that produces sound via vibrating strings above a hollow chamber in the guitar’s body. The vibrations carry through the air and do not require electrical amplification (although
      many acoustic guitars also function as electric guitars).</p>
    <h4 class="sub-head2">Classical</h4>
    <p class="pa">The classical guitar (also known as the nylon-string guitar or Spanish guitar) is a member of the guitar family used in classical music and other styles.The materials and the methods of classical guitar construction may vary, but
      the typical shape is either modern classical guitar or that historic classical guitar similar to the early romantic guitars of France and Italy</p>

      <dt>What is a piano?</dt>
      <dd>Piano, also called pianoforte, French piano or pianoforte,
        German Klavier, a <b><em>keyboard musical instrument</em></b> having wire
        strings that sound when struck by felt-covered hammers operated
        from a keyboard.</dd><br>


      <dt>How many keys do a piano have?</dt>
      <dd>The standard modern piano contains 88 keys and
        has a compass of seven full octaves plus a few keys.</dd><br>


      <dt>Who invented the piano and when?</dt>
      <dd>Bartolomeo Cristofori is often credited with inventing
        the piano about 1709, though this has been disputed.
        Cristofori’s piano was not the first instrument using
        keyboard striking action; examples of the piano principle
        existed as early as about 1440. However, the modern piano
        design stems from Cristofori’s creation.</dd><br>

      <dt>Who are some of the greatest pianists?</dt>
      <dd>There have been many great pianists over time
        with a variety of styles. This list includes but is
        not limited to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven,
        Frédéric Chopin, Myra Hess, and Clara Schumann. One of the
        best-known pianists of the early 21st century is Mitsuko
        Uchida.</dd><br>

    <h2 class="h2-head" id="history">History of the piano</h2>
    <p class="para">The piano was founded on earlier technological
      innovations in keyboard instruments. Pipe organs have
      been used since antiquity, and as such, the development
      of pipe organs enabled instrument builders to learn about
      creating keyboard mechanisms for sounding pitches.
      The first string instruments with struck strings were the
      hammered dulcimers,[6] which were used since the Middle
      Ages in Europe. During the Middle Ages, there were several
      attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with
      struck strings.</p><br>

        <h1 id = "history" style="padding-top: 15%;">History</h1>
        <p>Drums are some historical instruments used by ancestors,which dates back over thousand years <br>
            Initially these equipments were utilised for communication and tributing as an accompaniment for dancing <br></p>
        <p>The first drums arrived in the Neolithic cultures originating from China but later spread to all of Asia.<br>
            This period also saw the creation of Bronze Dong Son Drums in Vietnam during 3000 BC. Sri Lanka and African people later discovered drums between 1000 and 500 BC </p>
        <p>First encounter of European with “modern” drum design came during the reign of ancient Greece and Rome, who dispersed drums that were traded from Africa across central and Western Europe.<br>
            Presence of drums in Europe was not prominent for centuries after. While Middle East, Asia and Japan become home of many drum designs, drums were very rarely used in Europe.<br>
            This changed significantly after European armies came back home after crusades, bringing with them technology, knowledge and objects that enabled beginning of the European Renaissance. <br>
            the steady stream of trade arriving via Genoa and Venetian ports, Europe started its centuries long recovery after harsh Dark and Middle Ages.</p>

        <h1 id = "types" style="padding-top: 15%;">Drum types</h1>
        <header>The following looks at the alternate types of drums for beginners: <br></header>

        <h2>Snare Drum</h2>
        <img src="https://takelessons.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/snare-450x300.jpg" alt="Snare drum">
        <p>The snare is the center of a five-piece drum kit. The snare drum is responsible for the loud crack, usually on upbeats, that you hear during your favorite songs. <br></p>

        <h2>Bass Drum</h2>
        <img src="https://takelessons.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bass-drum-450x300.jpg" alt="Bass drum">
        <p>The bass, or kick drum, is easy to find because it’s the largest drum in a drum kit. <br> Most bass drum shells are made from woods like maple, heartwood birch, and mahogany, but you can also find bass drum shells made from metals. <br></p>

        <h2>Toms, Hi-Hat, and Cymbals</h2>
        <img src="https://takelessons.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/toms-and-cymbals-450x300.jpg" alt="The toms">
        <p>The toms, or tom-toms, are mounted either above the bass drum or held up by adjustable legs. <br> In a five-piece drum kit, there are two types of toms: the rack toms and the floor toms. The floor and rack toms are most commonly used during drum fills. <br> Like the other drums in the kit, the toms are generally made from wood or metal.</p>

      <img class="bongo" src="images/Bongos.jpg" alt="Blue Bongos">

      <p class="p-bongo">
        Bongos (Spanish: bongó) are an Afro-Cuban percussion instrument consisting of a pair of small open
        bottomed hand drums of different sizes.
        They are struck with both hands, most commonly in an eight-stroke pattern called Martello (hammer).
        They are mainly employed in the rhythm section of son Cubano and salsa ensembles, often alongside other drums such as the
        larger congas and the stick-struck timbales.<br><br><br>

        Bongo drummers (bongos Eros) emerged as the only drummers of son Cubano ensembles in eastern Cuba toward the
        end of the 19th century. The instrument
        remained important as son groups evolved into larger conjuntos and orchestras in Havana in the 1940s, at which point they
        began to share the stage with congas.
        Bongos later reached the United States, where they are commonly played in salsa, Afro-Cuban jazz, Latin rock and
        other genres.<br><br><br>

        Bongo drums are about 20 centimeters (8 in) high and have diameters of approximately 20 centimeters (8 in) and
        25 centimeters (10 in) (the smaller drum is called
        macho, male, and the larger drum, hembra, female). They are the smallest drums in Latin percussion, some models
        being only 15 centimeters (6 in) in diameter.
        The shells of the drums and the bridge (the small block that joins them) are usually made of wood, although
        fiberglass is also common. The heads are typically made
        of calfskin and attached to the shells via steel hardware that enables their tuning. Originally, metal tacks
        were used, so tuning had to be done by heating the skins.<br><br>

        <b>Are the bongos easy to learn? </b><br><br>

        So maybe you're eyeing those bongo drums you saw at the music store for the past few weeks,
        but you're not sure how much time you need to learn how to play them. How long does it take to learn to play bongos?<br><br>

        Learning to play the bongos with traditional Afro-Cuban music will take at least two weeks of daily practice
        if you have prior percussion experience. Without prior percussion experience, it may take around 2 months depending on your music ability.
        Other music genres will take less or more time depending on their complexity.
